# ðŸ›’ Acme Basket CLI

A test-driven Ruby command-line application that simulates a shopping basket. Includes dynamic offers, tiered delivery pricing, and an optional interactive **fancy UI** with emoji feedback and live cart updates.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Features

- Add or remove products by code
- Automatically applies available offers (e.g., Buy One Get One Half Price on R01)
- Tiered delivery fee logic based on subtotal
- Optional **fancy UI** with **live cart overview after each action**
- Fully tested with RSpec

---

## ðŸ’¡ Precision Assumption

- When applying offers, we truncate to 2 decimal places without rounding.
- For example:
  ```bash
  32.95 / 2 = 16.475 â†’ becomes 16.47 (not 16.48)
